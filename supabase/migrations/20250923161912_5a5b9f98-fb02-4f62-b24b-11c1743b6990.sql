-- ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Enable RLS on tables with policies but RLS disabled

-- Enable RLS on books table (has policy but RLS was disabled)
ALTER TABLE public.books ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Enable RLS on subjects table (has policy but RLS was disabled)
ALTER TABLE public.subjects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify the fix by checking if RLS is now enabled
